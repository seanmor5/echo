# Echo

> Give your agents a voice with Echo.

Echo is a WebSocket server for conversational agents with low latency and support for interrupts. You can read the [origin blog post here](#).

## Usage

Echo is an [Elixir Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) application. You can run the server by installing Elixir and Phoenix, setting the [required environment variables](#customization) and running:

```sh
$ mix phx.server
```

This will start a server running on port 4000 with a single endpoint: `ws://localhost:4000/conversation`. I highly recommend you run on a GPU-enabled machine and set `XLA_ENV=cuda120`. I can get very low latency, but only by running transcription on a GPU.

### Interacting with the WebSocket Server

> WARNING: This API is **extremely** alpha. I know it's kind of confusing, sorry.

The WebSocket server uses [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/index.html) for serialization. Each message object contains a `type` field representing the type of message to send, and then some additional data. These are the types of messages you can send to the client:

- `{type: "open", prompt: "System prompt for agent"}`
- `{type: "audio", audio: ArrayBuffer}`
- `{type: "state", state: "waiting"}`

After connecting, you should send an "open" message to the server with the system prompt for the agent you'd like to interact with. The server will immediately start pushing audio. The types of messages the server sends to the client are:

- `{type: "audio", audio: ArrayBuffer}`
- `{type: "token", token: String}`
- `{type: "interrupt", token: String}`

Each audio event sends data as a MessagePack binary which will get decoded as a UInt8Array. The first 8 bytes are a sequencing token for interrupts. You should use the sequencing token to avoid race conditions in the event your agent is interrupted in the middle of streaming audio from ElevenLabs. The rest of the audio is a buffer matching the format provided in your configuration. For example, I recommend using `pcm_44100` which will output 16-bit PCM audio data. Then you can convert the incoming audio data like:

```js
const data = decoded.audio;

const tokenBytes = data.slice(0, 8);
const textDecoder = new TextDecoder("utf-8");
const token = textDecoder.decode(tokenBytes);

const audio = new Int16Array(data.buffer, data.byteOffset + 8, (data.byteLength - 8) / Int16Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT);
this.enqueueAudioData({ token, audio });
```

Assuming you're using a queue to sequence incoming audio events.

`interrupt` events tell you that your model has been interrupted while speaking, and you should stop playback. Each interrupt event creates a new sequencing token to avoid race conditions. `token` events update the sequencing token for audio playback.

You should send data to the server in the same endianness as the server. You should also send it as FP32 PCM data. I recommend streaming to the server in chunks between 30ms and 250ms. You *must* sample audio at 16_000 Hz. The VAD model requires audio sampled at 16_000 hurts to work well. It does not support samples smaller than 30ms. Here's an example which pushes every 128ms:

```js
    const audioOptions = {
      sampleRate: SAMPLING_RATE,
      echoCancellation: true,
      noiseSuppression: true,
      autoGainControl: true,
      channelCount: 1,
    };

    navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: audioOptions }).then((stream) => {
      const source = this.microphoneContext.createMediaStreamSource(stream);
      this.processor = this.microphoneContext.createScriptProcessor(2048, 1, 1);

      this.processor.onaudioprocess = (e) => {
        const pcmFloat32Data = this.convertEndianness32(
          e.inputBuffer.getChannelData(0),
          this.getEndianness(),
          this.el.dataset.endianness
        );

        const message = { type: "audio", audio: pcmFloat32Data };

        this.socket.send(encoder.encode(message), { type: "application/octet-stream" });
      };

      source.connect(this.processor);
      this.processor.connect(this.microphoneContext.destination);
    });
```

### Configuration

Configuration is limited right now. The only supported LLM provider is OpenAI. The only supported TTS provider is ElevenLabs. You must set API keys for both:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY`

The STT model is `distil-whisper/distil-medium.v2` running with Nx and Bumblebee. I plan to add an support for customizable LLMs via external OpenAI-compatible endpoints, as well as LLMs running directly in server with Nx and Bumblebee.

There are a few TTS-specific customization options. If possible, I recommend keeping the defaults:

```
ELEVEN_LABS_VOICE_ID=ThT5KcBeYPX3keUQqHPh
ELEVEN_LABS_MODEL_ID=eleven_turbo_v2
ELEVEN_LABS_OPTIMIZE_STREAMING_LATENCY=2
ELEVEN_LABS_OUTPUT_FORMAT=pcm_44100
```
